Log File Parser - Industry Standard Approach
Objective:
Read large log files (e.g., web server logs) using streams to handle memory efficiently.

Parse log data to extract meaningful insights like request counts, response times, error rates, and other relevant metrics.

Write parsed insights into an output file (CSV or JSON format) for further analysis or reporting.

Optimize performance for handling large files with minimal memory consumption.
